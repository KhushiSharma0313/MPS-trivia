## Motivation
As a student majoring in computer science, I'm deeply passionate about leveraging technology to address real-world issues and create meaningful impact. When confronted with the research on chronic absenteeism in Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS), I saw an opportunity to utilize my skills to optimize this crucial information.
Gamification is one of the most effective ways of spreading information, particularly when dealing with complex topics. By creating a trivia game centered around chronic absenteeism in MPS, my goal is to motivate teachers, students, and parents alike to actively engage with the issue.

## Brainstorming
In brainstorming for a public-facing project on chronic absenteeism in MPS, I aimed to optimize my research. Recognizing the under-discussed nature of this issue, I chose a tech-driven solution. Exploring various genres and mediums, I found the idea of a trivia game most appealing.

## Building the Project
### 1. Game Structure
The trivia game features questions and answers derived directly from the research conducted for the Segment Two project. Each question presents users with four options and a 15-second timer to select their answer. After choosing an option, the game provides a fun fact related to the question, along with its source, to inform users about the issue of chronic absenteeism in MPS.
